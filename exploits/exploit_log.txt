I've recorded everything I've attempted in this text file. Be warned, some of
these are probably outright silly. I'm learning!

Description: Attempted a basic CSRF exploit. Logged in as a user and browsed to
  another page I hosted on a simple Python server. It contained an image with 
  the logout url:
    http://localhost/wp-login.php?action=logout
Status: Failing. I am looking into what prevented this from working.
